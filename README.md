This project is my attempt to understand how China’s economy and society have changed in the past decade using real data and basic programming. As an undergraduate student majoring in economics, I often felt that textbook models could only explain so much. I wanted to move beyond theoretical cases and see what the numbers actually say about China’s growth, income, consumption, and education.
The datasets are organized into four CSV files: annual macroeconomic indicators (GDP, GNI, and industry value added), per capita income (mean, median, wage, business, property, transfers), per capita consumption expenditure (by category: services, food, housing, health, education, etc.), and education statistics (average number of students per 100,000 population by school stage). I used Python with pandas and matplotlib for all data processing and visualization.

Several trends stood out in the analysis. Despite some impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, both GDP and GNI have grown steadily over the past ten years. Per capita disposable income—both mean and median—has increased every year, and the gap between them is gradually shrinking, which may point to improvements in income distribution. Consumption patterns show a clear shift: services, health, education, and cultural spending are growing faster than traditional categories like food or clothing. At the same time, enrollment numbers at all educational levels have continued to rise, suggesting a sustained improvement in access to education and the overall quality of human capital.

Doing this project made me realize how much more efficient and independent I can be when I use the right tools for data analysis. Coding, which once seemed intimidating, turned out to be both enjoyable and rewarding—especially when it helps answer questions I actually care about. Instead of relying on pre-made reports or waiting for someone else to interpret the data, I learned to trust my own ability to handle large datasets and draw my own conclusions. This experience has inspired me to further strengthen my skills in empirical research and to tackle more complex topics in my future studies.

All the code can be found in `analysis.py`, and the figures generated by the analysis are saved in the `output_figures` folder. To reproduce the results, simply install the requirements and run the script:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python analysis.py
